{"name":"FOF","tagline":"Framework of frameworks. A rad web application development system starting with vagrant, using Phalcon PHP for server side framework and Gumby 2 for frontend framework.","body":"#FOF\r\n\r\n##Concept\r\n\r\nA dev box and deployment tool in one. It can be used by teams very effectively. But it is geared to a one man development/sysadmin team.\r\n\r\n###RAD\r\n\r\nGet a development environment and web application up and running in less than an hour with all necessary and useful development tools with a modern PHP framework and frontend framework pre-installed and pre-configured and do it by only installing virtualbox, vagrant and running one command: `vagrant up`.\r\n\r\n####Frameworks\r\n\r\n- Phalcon PHP\r\n- Gumby 2\r\n- AngularJs\r\n\r\n####Package Management\r\n\r\n- PHP: Composer\r\n- JS: Bower\r\n\r\n####Tools\r\n\r\n- Phalcon Web Tools\r\n- PhpMyAdmin\r\n- Puphpet\r\n- CodeMirror\r\n- Prebuilt Project Dev Admin to reconfigure project, handle sass/compass, add/remove javascript libraries\r\n\r\n###Deployment\r\n\r\nPlus, I as developer want to be able to mock up an idea quickly, add necessary linux packages on the fly when needed and get at least a halfway working application going before I put it on an other environment, i.e. live on the web. But by the time the application is too that point, I have no idea how custom my box is by then.\r\n\r\nSo I want to be able to change the configuration of the box in puppet. That way when the site is live, I have a template of the server I need waiting and the site can be live quickly.\r\n\r\n##Project Contents\r\n\r\n###Vagrant box\r\n- Apache2\r\n- MySQL\r\n- PHP 5.4\r\n- MongoDB\r\n- PHP QA Tools\r\n- Phalcon PHP\r\n- Phalcon Devtools\r\n- Xdebug\r\n- PhpMyAdmin\r\n- nodejs\r\n- grunt\r\n- bower\r\n- sass\r\n- compass\r\n- claymate\r\n\r\n###Frameworks\r\n- Phalcon PHP\r\n\r\n####To add\r\n- Gumby 2\r\n- Angular.js\r\n- Require.js\r\n- More needed services to phalcon project\r\n- Add mongo service to phalcon project\r\n\r\n##Getting Started\r\n\r\nI have tried to keep most of the development environment as well as tools self contained in the virtualbox. But you will need the following to get started.\r\n\r\n- [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org)\r\n- [Vagrant](http://getvagrant.com)\r\n- Git (Optional: if you want to git pull this project instead of downloading the zip)\r\n\r\n###Steps after installing above\r\n\r\n- run `git clone https://github.com/eristoddle/FOF.git` or download the archive and extract it\r\n- open terminal in `FOF/vagrant`\r\n- run `vagrant up`\r\n- wait for vagrant to finish\r\n- set up this in your host's host file: `192.168.56.101  fof.local` (Planning to change this so http://192.168.56.101 works for the project but can't quite figure out how to set the main apache doc root, though creating a virtual host seems easy. Editing a host file adds another step to the 3 steps I claim and I planning on keeping it 3 steps.)\r\n- Browse to http://fof.local\r\n- Your application files will be located in `FOF/www/` and this folder is shared with the vagrant box var/www\r\n- PhpMyAdmin will be at http://192.168.56.101/phpmyadmin\r\n- fof database is already is use in project. Modify it to add tables. Then use http://fof.local/webtools.php to create models and scaffolding\r\n- Xdebug is installed and usable in box\r\n- ssh to vagrant box with `vagrant ssh`. Then all command line tools in box are available, including:\r\n    - PHP QA Tools\r\n    - Phalcon developer tools in Phalcon\r\n\r\n##Issues\r\n\r\n- Can't figure out how to set Apache's document root so I can just browse to http://192.168.56.101, so have to use a virtual host and edit host's host file for now.\r\n- Phalcon dev tools installed but not available in path, known issue with dev tools\r\n- www-data permissions on a Windows host. cache files can't be written\r\n\r\n##TODO\r\n- Keep all dev tools in shell scripts\r\n- Move tools needed in all environments to puppet","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
