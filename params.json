{"name":"FOF","tagline":"Framework of frameworks. A rad web application development system starting with vagrant, using Phalcon PHP for server side framework and Gumby 2 for frontend framework.","body":"#FOF\r\n\r\n##Concept\r\n\r\nGet a development environment and web application up and running in less than an hour with all necessary and useful development tools with a modern PHP framework and frontend framework pre-installed and pre-configured and do it by only installing virtualbox, vagrant and running one command: `vagrant up`.\r\n\r\n##Project Contents\r\n\r\n###Vagrant box\r\n- Apache2\r\n- MySQL\r\n- PHP 5.4\r\n- MongoDB\r\n- PHP QA Tools\r\n- Phalcon PHP\r\n- Phalcon Devtools\r\n- Xdebug\r\n- PhpMyAdmin\r\n\r\n####To add\r\n- nodejs\r\n- grunt\r\n- bower\r\n- sass\r\n- compass\r\n- claymate\r\n\r\n###Frameworks\r\n- Phalcon PHP\r\n- Gumby 2\r\n\r\n####To add\r\n- Backbone.js\r\n- More needed services to project\r\n- Add mongo service to project\r\n- Fix Phalcon webtools relative path issue\r\n\r\n##Getting Started\r\n\r\nI have tried to keep most of the development environment as well as tools self contained in the virtualbox. But you will need the following to get started.\r\n\r\n- [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org)\r\n- [Vagrant](http://getvagrant.com)\r\n- Git (Optional: if you want to git pull this project instead of downloading the zip)\r\n\r\n###Steps after installing above\r\n\r\n- run `git clone https://github.com/eristoddle/FOF.git` or download the archive and extract it\r\n- open terminal in `FOF/vagrant`\r\n- run `vagrant up`\r\n- wait for vagrant to finish\r\n- Browse to http://192.168.56.101\r\n- Your application files will be located in `FOF/www/` and this folder is shared with the vagrant box var/www\r\n- PhpMyAdmin will be at http://192.168.56.101/phpmyadmin\r\n- fof database is already is use in project. Modify it to add tables. Then use http://192.168.56.101/webtools.php to create models and scaffolding\r\n- Xdebug is installed and usable in box\r\n- ssh to vagrant box with `vagrant ssh`. Then all command line tools in box are available, including:\r\n    - PHP QA Tools\r\n    - Phalcon developer tools in Phalcon\r\n\r\n##Issues\r\n\r\n- Not picking up document root from `puppet/hieradata/common.yaml`? - Currently manually edited in box to `/var/www/public`\r\n- Volt cache directory not writable. Complete project user and group is vagrant. logs folder will have this issue too","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
